I aim to understand the social dimensions of the global scientific ecosystem by leveraging massive datasets, computational techniques, and social theory.

I have a PhD in [Informatics](https://luddy.indiana.edu/) from Indiana University Bloomington, where I wrote my dissertation [*"Embracing Complexity in the Science of Science"*](slides/dissertation_presentation.pdf) under the amazing mentorship of [Dr. Cassidy Sugimoto](https://ella.sice.indiana.edu/~sugimoto/index.php) and [Dr. Yong-Yeol Ahn](https://yongyeol.com/).
I am an alumni of the [Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/schools/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school).

When not working, I enjoy running, cooking, traveling, reading, and spending time with my wonderful wife and daughter.
