I'm a computational social scientist studying the social and epistemic dynamics of the global scientific ecosystem. To do so, I leverage neural-network based representation learning to construct simplified embeddings of bibliometric and social networks.

I am currently pursuing a PhD at Indiana University Bloomington in the department of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. I have been fortunate enough to be advised by Dr. Cassidy Sugimoto and am currently working as a research assistant on the Minerva-funded *Sciecne Genome* project under the supervision of Ahn Yong-Yeol. Apart from work, I enjoy running, cooking, traveling, and reading science fiction.
